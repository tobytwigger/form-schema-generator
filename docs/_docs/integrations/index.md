The form schema generator supports several UI kits out the box, including the portal UI kit and the Atlas UI Kit. 

An integration consists of a set of fields that can be used by the UI kit, possibly a Field Generator for generating the
UI kit fields, and a transformer to convert the fields into the correct schema.
